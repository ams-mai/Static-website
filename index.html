                I was born on the month of October, a scorpio. Most people at present references a zodiac sign for everything but I just recently learned the obsession behind it
                and I personally think signs like that does not define a person's quality and characteristics (except if you're a capricorn).
                <br><br>
                I am the eldest daughter in our family. I have a younger sister that completes our family of four.
                Some may think that we're a small family, but for me, we are just the exact size.
                In my father's side of the family, I claimed the throne of being the eldest grandchild.
                It definitely felt good at first but I guess everything do come to an end.

                Since the beginning of my life, I gazed upon Puerto Galera. We may have moved and lived at three different barangays but nothing compares
                to a place we built called home. Puerto Galera is place full of beaches and mountains. 
                It is quiet and peaceful--perfect for vacations and rests. Tourists often visit my hometown but I rarely encounter one because the barangay I live in is far from attracting spots.
                <br><br>
                During my childhood, my parents were busy at work. I learned to become independent and entertained myself since I am 9.
                It wasn't that bad in fact it made me learn lots of skills. However, because of those moments in my life,
                I am raised to be timid. I often become awkward with peers and voluntarily choose to be alone most times.

                Balatero Elementary School <br> (S.Y. 2007 - 2014)
                <br><br>
                During my stay here in elementary, I barely talk to my classmates
                and teachers. Looking back, I spent those times only with my two friends.
                It wasn't that bad, but it definitely affected my social skills.
                <br><br>
                Despite those things, I finished grade 6 as the class' third honor.

                Puerto Galera National High School <br> (S.Y. 2014 - 2018)
                <br><br>
                I graduated with High Honors but it sure is a rollercoaster ride. <br>
                I attended a class called Special Science Class which was full of honor students all around Puerto Galera.
                It was scary and I remember myself trembling everytime because I'm afraid to be called
                and answer wrong leading my classmates to laughter. In short, I thought I will be bullied for my timidness
                but they didn't. <br> (Still, my social anxiety remained at peak.)

                <br><br>
                I spent my senior high years in STEM strand under Academic Track which
                awarded me as With Honors.
                My stay was good and for the first time in years I felt my anxiety go down.
                I think I felt at ease because I broke free from a pressuring environment
                brought by my previous class.
                <br><br>
                Sadly, we graduated online due to covid-19 lockdown.

                Honestly, I didn't consider IT as my dream course way back junior high school,
                but due to my acceptance in DOST Scholarship I have decided to take it on.
                Information Technology is not an easy course, but it definitely sparks my mind
                and makes me wonder to what more can I do.
                <br><br>
                Studying this course benefits my physical incapabilities and also keeps me motivated
                to continue on my life. (Who wouldn't be when I am taking it on with my partner.)

                I regret loads of things. 
                <br><br>
                My life has been a series of trial and error. Everything I do just reflects
                how indecisive and inconsistent I am.
                <br><br>
                I regret my childhood. I regret being a child achiever because it made me thirst
                for appreciation and recognition. I regret being independent because it made
                fear relying on others and spiked my obsession to control. I regret growing up so fast 
                that made me enjoy less of those playful times.
                <br><br>
                I regret my high school life. I regret not being energetic and appealing which made me be consumed
                by academic anxiety and pressure. I regret wasting my junior years with a guy that traumatised and
                blinded my youthful mind. I regret not going out more often with friends and classmates
                which made me incapable of socializing to peers. I regret holing myself in my
                comfortzone which made me just the same as before.

                I regret my senior high years. I regret being the pressuring classmate that I hated
                before. I regret not involving much of my classmates as response to my obsession to control.
                I regret hating myself for being incompetent and unable to achieve as much as before.

                There are situations in our lives that give us opportunities to choose while
                there are situations that we are just left in between.
                <br><br>
                I didn't live a wonderful life, that's for sure, but I can say that I have made 
                my younger self proud for surviving and continuing despite those regrets.

                I currently study Information Technology in Batangas State University. I mentioned
                before that it is not my actual dream course. Before, I thought of taking Nursing. It was
                not exactly a dream, I'm just fascinated by medical practices but was too lazy and impatient
                for Medicine Courses. I remember myself watching tv series and korean dramas featuring doctors
                and other medical practitioners and be amazed by how good and exciting they do things.
                <br><br>
                However, later on my life, I realized that my body will not be able to physically take on
                the challenge of being a nurse. I admitted that flaw and it made me take a turn to office jobs.
                <br><br>
                After college, I plan on working in IT industries to widen my experience. If all things go well,
                I will stay in the country so I can be closer to my family. However, if things
